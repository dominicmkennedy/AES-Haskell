# AES-Haskell

This project is an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) following the standard set forth in [FIPS 197](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf).  
This implementation was written from scratch in 100% pure Haskell, and as such it does not rely on any outside modules.  
The purpose of this project is to improve my Haskell (feedback is accepted and appreciated). The project is built using cabal and includes a full testing suite which can be run using `cabal test`.  That being said this code should **not** be used in any production environment.
